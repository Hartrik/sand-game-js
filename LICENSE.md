Sand Game JS is open-source software in the technical sense of the term.
Open sources facilitate scripting, scenario writing, and modding.
You are free to download the source codes, compile them on your own, and experiment.
Forks on GitHub are acceptable, but a backlink should be maintained.

However, Sand Game JS is NOT open-source software in the legal sense of the term.
It is not automatically permitted to publish distributions, derivative works, or parts thereof.
Please contact me, and if it does not represent competition, you will receive permission, or we can agree on the terms.

Naturally, I am not interested in being swept away by competition using the code that I wrote myself.
I hope you understand my position, the goal is to protect sandsaga.com.
