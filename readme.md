# Sand Game JS

Sand Game JS is a fast, free and open-source falling-sand game for desktop & mobile browsers.
It allows players to experiment with various elements, such as sand, soil, water and fire.
With grass and trees growing on soil, and other natural processes, Sand Game JS offers a unique experience.
It is primarily tested on Google Chrome and Google Chrome for Android.

Browser-based successor to [Sand Game 2](https://github.com/Hartrik/Sand-Game-2), which was originally developed in Java (JavaFX).

## Development

Dev build: https://harag.cz/app/sand-game-js?stage=dev (with test tools enabled, sometimes with experimental changes)

Build:

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`.

`npm run dev` builds the library, then keeps rebuilding it whenever the source files change using rollup-watch.

`npm test` builds the library, then tests it.

Debugging tips:
- Use `alt` + `ctrl` + `shift` + `middle mouse button` to debug an element.
- Stop processing using `ctrl` + `enter` and then press (or hold) `ctrl` + `space` for running one simulation iteration.
    - Alternatively `ctrl` + `shift` + `space` will run the specified number of iterations â€“ at once, without rendering and delays.
- Global variables, accessible from browser console: `sandGame`, `brushes`
